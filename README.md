# APPOINTMENT-CALENDAR-An-Android-Application
Everything is to be made simple, that is folk’s expectation. Here is an application that could make work easier for user. This android application basically works silently as a background process in reading the message that a user receives. It will scan for keywords like call, message, mail, ring etc. followed by words like “me, --some name—“etc. Once a word is found, the data is collected and appended to the calendar as a reminder for the user. In this way, the risk of remembrance could be eradicated and prompt the user as a notification. As a part of further work, the application could be extended in skimming through the mails, voice calls for keywords and recording them in the calendar would make the application more effective.
